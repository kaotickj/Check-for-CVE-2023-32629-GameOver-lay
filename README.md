# Check for CVE-2023-32629 GameOver(lay) 
Script Overview:
The script is designed to perform security checks on an Ubuntu system to detect vulnerabilities related to the GameOver(lay) flaws. It checks for two specific vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-2640 and CVE-2023-32629, which are present in the Linux kernel's OverlayFS module. The script also checks whether OverlayFS is being used on the system.

Detailed Description:

Function Definitions:

has_git_installed(): Checks if the git command-line tool is installed on the system.
is_in_git_repository(): Checks if the system is currently in a Git repository.
check_vulnerable_kernel_versions(): Compares the current kernel version with a list of known vulnerable versions to determine if the system is running a vulnerable kernel version.
check_vulnerable_kernel_function(): Uses sudo to search for the presence of a specific vulnerable function (ovl_copy_up_meta_inode_data) within kernel source code files.
is_overlayfs_used(): Checks if OverlayFS is being used on the system by searching for "overlay" in the output of the mount command.
Root Privilege Check:

The script starts by checking if the user has root privileges (using the os.geteuid() function) to determine whether sudo should be used for specific checks. This is relevant for the check_vulnerable_kernel_function() function that requires access to system files.
Git Installation Check:

The script checks if the git command-line tool is installed on the system using the has_git_installed() function. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
Starting Security Checks:

The script begins by printing a message indicating that the security checks are starting.
Git Repository Check:

The script checks if the system is in a Git repository using the is_in_git_repository() function. If it is, a message is printed confirming that the system is in a Git repository; if not, a message indicates that the system is not in a Git repository and the CVE-2023-2640 check is skipped.
Vulnerable Kernel Version Check:

The script uses the check_vulnerable_kernel_versions() function to compare the current kernel version (retrieved from os.uname().release) with a list of known vulnerable versions. If a vulnerable version is found, a message indicates the presence of a vulnerable kernel version.
Vulnerable Kernel Function Check:

The script uses the check_vulnerable_kernel_function() function to search for the presence of the vulnerable function (ovl_copy_up_meta_inode_data) within kernel source code files. It utilizes sudo for this check since it requires access to system files. If the function is found, a message indicates the presence of the vulnerable kernel function.
OverlayFS Usage Check:

The script uses the is_overlayfs_used() function to check whether OverlayFS is being used on the system. If OverlayFS mounts are detected in the output of the mount command, a message indicates its usage; otherwise, a message indicates its absence.
Completion Message:

After all checks are performed, a message indicates that the security checks have been completed.
Note: It's important to run the script with a thorough understanding of its functions and implications. Be cautious when using sudo to access system files, and ensure that the script's checks align with your system's configuration and environment.


The "GameOver(lay)" vulnerabilities are two high-severity security flaws found in the Ubuntu kernel, specifically within the OverlayFS module. These vulnerabilities were disclosed by cybersecurity researchers and have the potential to enable local privilege escalation attacks. Local privilege escalation refers to an attacker gaining higher levels of access and control over a system than they were initially authorized for.

Here's a brief overview of the two vulnerabilities:

CVE-2023-2640:

This vulnerability arises from inadequate permissions checks in certain scenarios in the OverlayFS module.
An unprivileged user can set privileged extended attributes on mounted files, leading to them being set on upper files without proper security checks.
This can enable an attacker to manipulate files in a way that grants elevated privileges, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the system.
CVE-2023-32629:

This vulnerability is another instance of inadequate permissions checks within the OverlayFS module.
Specifically, it occurs during the execution of the ovl_do_setxattr function on Ubuntu kernels using OverlayFS.
An attacker with local access can exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining root-like access to the system.
In summary, both vulnerabilities involve insufficient permissions checks in the OverlayFS module, which could be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected Ubuntu systems. These vulnerabilities emphasize the importance of proper security practices in software development and the need for prompt updates to fix such issues. Ubuntu released fixes for these vulnerabilities on July 24, 2023.
